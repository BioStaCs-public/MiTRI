# Transcriptional Reprogramming of Tumor-Associated Microbiome Creates Specific Epitope Repertoire
## Overview
MiTRI is a computational framework for quantifying microbial transcriptional reprogramming in tumor microenvironments and identifying tumor-specific microbial epitopes for cancer immunotherapy.
### Key Features
- Quantify Microbial Transcriptional Reprogramming: Calculate MiTRI scores to measure differential gene expression patterns of tumor-resident microbes
- Identify Tumor-Specific Antigens: Discover microbial peptides exclusively expressed in tumor tissues
- Pan-Cancer Analysis: Applicable across multiple cancer types
